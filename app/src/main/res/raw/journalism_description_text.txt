"The journalism major prepares students for jobs in news organizations. Students learn to find and tell stories that matter on multiple platforms for a variety of audiences. They develop storytelling skills in audio, visual and written forms. They learn what makes a story important, how to gather credible information, and how to present it in the most effective way while balancing the ethical and legal needs of news organizations and audiences."
