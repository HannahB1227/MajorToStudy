"A major in biology is valuable because of the important role that biology plays in our everyday lives. An understanding of basic biological principles is crucial in interpreting the implications of environmental degradation and loss of biodiversity, the impact of genetic engineering and biotechnology in crop improvement, the treatment of disease, forensic medicine, and legal and ethical issues associated with the above."
